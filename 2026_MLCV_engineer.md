## FHE Engineer position

TT-logic is a cutting-edge start-up, part of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore (through its incubator NTUitive). The company specializes in developing interpretable, compact and verifiable neural network models that can be deployed with privacy-preserving inference. We provide transparent, understandable, and secure AI solutions to clients, leveraging TTnet, a technology developed at NTU. 


### Job Summary:

Thanks to a recently awarded tech-development grant, we are seeking a talented and motivated Machine Learning/Computer Vision Engineer to join our team. Your role will be to extend our existing TTnet training architecture (in MLflow) to support vision and multimodal tasks and help in the development of a quantization-to-TTnet pipeline. You will lead end-to-end model development: dataset curation, training/regularisation, training TTnet or quantization into TTnet, and accuracy/latency trade-off studies. You will collaborate with a privacy-preserving technologies engineer and our full-stack engineers to integrate your models into deployable privacy-preserving pilots. 

This role offers an exciting opportunity to work with cutting-edge technology, shape the future of XAI/privacy-preserving AI, and contribute to the success of a promising startup.


### Responsibilities:

- Design and develop compact computer vision / multimodal architectures and quantization strategies for our privacy-preserving inference product.
- Adapt and evolve our products based on client preferences and emerging technologies.
- Collaborate with Full Stack engineers to integrate your tools pipeline into the TTnet software architecture.
- Write clean, maintainable code and conduct thorough testing to identify and resolve any issues or bugs.
- Stay up to date with the latest industry trends and emerging technologies to continuously improve the product. 


### Qualifications:

- Bachelor, Master, or PhD degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related field.
- Proven experience in Machine Learning with prior model training experience.
- Proficiency in ML libraries such as scikit-learn, PyTorch.
- Strong understanding of Machine Learning architecture principles and design patterns.
- Effective communication and interpersonal skills to collaborate with other engineers.


### Remuneration and Benefits:

Recruiting is performed via Nanyang Technological University. We offer a competitive compensation package commensurate with your skills and experience. In addition to a competitive salary, we provide a comprehensive benefits package that includes health insurance, vacation leave, and opportunities for professional development and growth.


### Start Date: 

January/February 2026.


### Contract Duration: 

12/18 months, extendable.


### Location: 

NTU, Singapore.


### How to Apply:

If you are passionate about Explainable/privacy-preserving AI and eager to contribute to the development of our innovative machine learning solution, we would love to hear from you. Please submit your resume, cover letter, and any relevant supporting documents/information (links to code/repos welcome) to thomas.peyrin@ntu.edu.sg with the subject line "ML/CV Engineer - Application". Applications will be accepted until the position is filled. Only shortlisted candidates will be contacted for further steps in the selection process.
