Welcome to the Symmetric Key and Lightweight Cryptography Lab (SYLLAB) page.
Welcome to the SYmmetric and Lightweight cryptography Lab (SYLLAB). We are part of the Coding and Cryptography Research Group at the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of Nanyang Technological University. The lab is led by Prof Thomas Peyrin and it includes several postdocs and PhD students. The research scope is the analysis and design of symmetric-key primitives (hash functions, block and stream ciphers, MACs, etc) and lightweight cryptography. The lab is supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation Fellowship 2012 (NRF-NRFF2012-06).
