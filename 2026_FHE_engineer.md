TT-logic is a cutting-edge start-up, part of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore (through its incubator NTUitive). The company specializes in developing interpretable, compact and verifiable neural network models that can be deployed with privacy-preserving inference. We provide transparent, understandable, and secure AI solutions to clients, leveraging TTnet, a technology developed at NTU. 


##Job Summary:

Thanks to a recently awarded tech-development grant, we are seeking a talented and motivated Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Engineer to join our team. Your role will be to implement and optimize TTnet privacy-preserving inference through Zama's Concrete-ML library and other FHE libraries, manage cryptographic parameters, and compilation. You will help finalize prototypes and ship reproducible, containerized, and well-documented packages. You will collaborate with a Machine Learning engineer and our full-stack engineers to integrate your FHE pipeline into deployable privacy-preserving pilots in clients' environments. 

This role offers an exciting opportunity to work with cutting-edge technology, shape the future of XAI/privacy-preserving AI, and contribute to the success of a promising startup.


##Responsibilities:

- Design and develop a FHE pipeline (based on industry available libraries) for machine learning / computer vision use-cases, and deploy privacy-preserving inference to clients environment. 
- Adapt and evolve our products based on client preferences and emerging technologies.
- Collaborate with Full Stack engineers to integrate your tools pipeline into the TTnet software architecture.
- Write clean, maintainable code and conduct thorough testing to identify and resolve any issues or bugs.
- Stay up to date with the latest industry trends and emerging technologies to continuously improve the product. 


##Qualifications:

- Bachelor, Master or PhD degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Cryptography, or a related field.
- Experience with Concrete-ML library from Zama or other FHE/crypto libraries.
- Hands-on Docker and CI/CD experience, comfort with Linux tooling, clear documentation.
- Effective communication and interpersonal skills to collaborate with other engineers.


##Remuneration and Benefits:

Recruiting is performed via Nanyang Technological University. We offer a competitive compensation package commensurate with your skills and experience. In addition to a competitive salary, we provide a comprehensive benefits package that includes health insurance, vacation leave, and opportunities for professional development and growth.


##Start Date: 

January/February 2026.


##Contract Duration: 

12/18 months, extendable.


##Location: 

NTU, Singapore.


##How to Apply:

If you are passionate about Explainable/privacy-preserving AI and eager to contribute to the development of our innovative machine learning solution, we would love to hear from you. Please submit your resume, cover letter, and any relevant supporting documents/information (links to code/repos welcome) to thomas.peyrin@ntu.edu.sg with the subject line "FHE Engineer - Application". Applications will be accepted until the position is filled. Only shortlisted candidates will be contacted for further steps in the selection process.
